Olfaction encodes chemical information through distributed activation across hundreds of olfactory receptors (ORs), forming a high-dimensional and nonlinear receptor–ligand landscape. Despite advances in molecular modeling, our understanding of this space remains constrained by the scarcity of experimental receptor affinity data. Existing AI models often map molecular structures directly to perceptual descriptors, bypassing the receptor activation spectra that biologically mediate odor perception. Here we propose Receptor-Anchored Metric Supervision (RAMS), a perception consistent framework for digital olfaction that fine-tunes a drug-target affinity (DTA) model using perceptual consistency rather than explicit receptor measurements. By integrating nine odorant datasets and optimizing for semantic coherence within odorant clusters, the model learns to reconstruct biologically interpretable receptor activation spectra. The fine-tuned model produced receptor activation spectra that aligned more closely with real experimental data and captured coherent relationships between perceptual similarity, receptor discriminative capacity, and anatomical expression levels. Analyses further highlight the disproportionate role of specific receptor families, identifying the understudied OR52 group as a potential key driver in primary odor recognition. This approach offers a scalable and mechanistically grounded route to model olfactory transduction, bridging molecular structure and receptor-anchored perception representation, advancing the digital representation and synthesis of smell.
