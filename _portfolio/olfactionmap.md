The receptor activation spectrum forms the molecular basis of olfaction, describing how odorant molecules activate diverse olfactory receptors. Predicting these activation patterns is crucial for digitizing smell perception, yet progress is hindered by the lack of high-quality, large-scale datasets that map chemical structures to receptor-level responses.

To address this limitation, this project develops a deep learning framework that is fine-tuned using label-consistency learning, where molecules with similar odor descriptions are encouraged to produce similar receptor activation spectra. This perceptual-consistency objective allows the model to learn from weak, indirectly aligned data and better capture the latent structure of olfactory perception.
