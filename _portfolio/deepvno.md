Researchers have long hoped to develop a universal electronic nose that can record the characteristics of gases' odors in a manner similar to how cameras capture visual images. However, when sensing gas mixtures, current gas sensor array exists severe problem of cross-sensitivity. To minimize cross-sensitivity, we are
 developing multi-parameter gas sensor array controlled by AI models. It can optimize it's working parameter based on current target, staying at the state of maxmiun selectivity.
