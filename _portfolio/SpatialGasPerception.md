In industrial settings, gas is an invisible yet crucial environmental factor. The diffusion of gas in the environment is influenced by factors such as wind, topography, and temperature gradients, exhibiting complex behavioral characteristics. We are developing a multi-modal sensing solution for gas detection, integrating various sensing modalities such as vision and olfaction. This approach enables the execution of real-world tasks such as gas source localization and mapping of gas concentration distribution, achieving comprehensive spatial gas perception.
