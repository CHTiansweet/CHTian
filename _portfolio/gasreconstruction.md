Gas Distribution Mapping (GDM) plays a vital role in industrial safety, environmental monitoring, and emergency response. Accurately reconstructing gas concentration fields enables timely detection of hazards and supports informed decision-making in complex environments. However, traditional GDM methods typically rely on dense and uniformly deployed sensor networks, which are costly, inflexible, and often impractical in unknown or dynamic spaces. Mobile robotic platforms offer a promising alternative by enabling flexible and efficient gas sensing. Yet, robotic GDM introduces challenges from unstructured sensor observations, which are sparse and spatially uneven. These characteristics hinder the performance of conventional interpolation techniques and many learning-based models that assume fixed input structures.

In this work, we propose a transformer-based model for GDM that directly addresses the challenge of reconstructing gas and wind fields from sparse, irregular sensor inputs. By leveraging self-attention and positional encoding, the model captures long-range spatial dependencies and adapts to varying sensor layouts. We train the model using simulated CFD data and validate it with real-world wind tunnel measurements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, including interpolation, Kernel DM+V, and CNN encoder-decoder across different levels of sampling sparsity and imbalance. The transformer exhibits strong robustness in low-observation regimes and is capable of reconstructing gas plumes even in the presence of sensor noise and environmental disturbances. This work highlights the potential of transformer architectures for real-world robotic GDM tasks under challenging sensing conditions. Data and code are publicly accessible.
