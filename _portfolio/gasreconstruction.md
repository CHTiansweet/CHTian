In industrial environments, accurate mapping of gas concentrations is crucial for ensuring worker safety, regulatory compliance, and environmental protection, especially in areas where COâ‚‚ emissions pose health risks. However, real-time monitoring presents substantial challenges
due to complex airflow patterns, turbulent diffusion, and the limitations of placing sensors across vast factory spaces.

To address these challenges, our project employs a physics-informed diffusion model that combines computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
simulations with real-world wind tunnel data. We pre-train the model using CFD data to learn baseline diffusion dynamics, then fine-tune it with experimental data to adapt to the real factory setting. 
This hybrid approach allows us to reconstruct comprehensive concentration distributions based on limited sensor inputs, creating a scalable and efficient solution for robust gas monitoring in dynamic industrial environments.
