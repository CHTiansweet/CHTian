My name is Changhao Tian, currently a final year phd student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, expecting to graduate by fall 2025. 

I received my Bachelor's degree of physics from Nanjing University, China at 2021. After that, I came to Nanyang Technological University, Singapore to pursue phd degree. My phd program is funded by Singapore International Graduate Award(SINGA) and A*Star Merit Award(AMA), which is one of the highest honor scholarships for international candidates from Singapore government. 

My research interests focus on **Multi-modal Machine Olfaction**, which integrates various sensor modalities to detect, localize, and assess gas concentrations in complex environments.

Multi-modal Machine Olfaction
======
Mimicking human senses has long been a fundamental motivation behind sensor design, leading to advancements in technologies that replicate vision, hearing, touch, and taste. Each of these senses has been successfully translated into sophisticated sensors, but machine olfaction, which aims to replicate the sense of smell, remains one of the most challenging to develop and is often considered the "last puzzle" in this quest.

The complexity of detecting, interpreting, and classifying gas components in the environment mirrors the intricacies of the human olfactory system. Unlike vision or hearing, which have direct analogs in camera and microphone technologies, olfaction requires intricate chemical sensing and a nuanced interpretation of complex mixtures of gases.

In my research, I approach machine olfaction from two key perspectives: gas mixture component identification and spatial gas perception.

Gas mixture component identification is a central challenge in machine olfaction. Real-world environments often contain complex mixtures of gases with varying concentrations. My work focuses on developing advanced algorithms that can identify components in these mixtures, using data from multi-modal sensors. By leveraging chemical sensors that detect specific volatile compounds and integrating data from environmental and optical sensors, I aim to build models that can accurately identify each component of a gas mixture, even in noisy environments. This capability is crucial for applications in hazardous gas detection, where accurately identifying harmful gases within a mixture can prevent potential dangers in industrial settings.

Spatial gas perception involves understanding the distribution of gas concentrations across a physical space. In this part of my research, I focus on creating models that can map gas distributions in real-world, using input from sensors that capture wind patterns, temperature gradients, and obstacle interference. The goal is to localize the source of gas leaks and track the spread of gases through complex environments. I aim to develop systems that can predict how gas will diffuse over time and how it interacts with environmental factors.
