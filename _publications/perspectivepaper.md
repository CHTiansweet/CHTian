Universal electronic nose (e-nose) is a type of advanced sensor that can analyze gases and provide odor descriptions in a manner akin to human olfaction. It is the ultimate goal of gas sensor research, but a challenge that is currently difficult to overcome. Here, we explore potential methods that could achieve this goal. We first introduce the current state of e-nose technology, including the electronic approach based on semiconductor materials, colorimetric approach based on color change of gas-sensitive colorants, and the biological approach based on biological macromolecules. Given the limitations of current technologies, we propose the key technologies needed to realize a universal e-nose. These encompass the development of multidimensional datasets, standardized processes for gas-sensitive material development, and the creation of complete and robust nose-on-chip systems. We also discuss the fundamental scientific research that may drive the development of these technologies, including cross-dimensional computational chemistry, non-equilibrium simulations of proteins, and large language models for label processing. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of establishing unified standards for high-quality datasets. These perspectives will provide guidance for developing the next generation of gas sensing systems, as well as sensors and databases related.
